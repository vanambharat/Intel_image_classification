# Intel_image_classification
In this project, I worked on Intel images i.e. images of buildings, forest, street, etc. I built a convolutional neural network and train it on this images. This is a multi class classification problem and I used Keras.
In this project I saw how I can create a CNN using different layers. Normalizing is an important step when working with any type of dataset. I will use this model to predict the class of the image supplied to the model.
This project has a vast scope, it can be used to classify satellite images, drone images, google images into different classes like sea, mountain, etc.
